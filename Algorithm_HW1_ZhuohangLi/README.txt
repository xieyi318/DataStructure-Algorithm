-All programs to run algorithms are written in Java
-All programs to plot are written in Python(using matplotlib)


-For the ThreeSum programs(including ThreeSum_naive, ThreeSum_sophisticated, ThreeSum_quadratic),
	1.to read data from file, put the file in the same dictionary and type file name 
	in command line arguements, for example "128int.txt".
	2.to read regular data, type the array directly in command line arguements, seperated by space, 
	for example "-1 0 1 1 2 5"(has to have more than 1 elements).

-For the UnionFind programs(including QuickFind. QuickUnion, WeightedQuickUnion),
	can ONLY read from files. To do so, put file in the same dictionary and 
	type file name in command line arguements, for example"512pair.txt"

-For the FarthestPair program,
	can ONLY read regular data. To do so, type the array directly in command line arguements, seperated by space, 
	for example "-37 4 877 36 -128 ".

-Thank you for your time and patience!
